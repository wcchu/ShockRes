# Carrier shock effect with resonant electron transition

This project is to model the effect of adding a Lorentz shaped resonance
in the dispersion term of a first-order field propagation equation.

There are two sub-projects:

1. In "freespace" folder, the code (in Julia) is to model the effect in 1-D propagation.
2. In "waveguide" folder, the code (in Fortran 90) is to model the effect propagating in a cylindrical waveguide. The electric field is taken as the field strength corresponding to the effective mode area.
